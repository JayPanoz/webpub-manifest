# Default Context Definitions

##Identifier

A Web Publication Manifest must contain an identifier. The identifier must be a valid URN:

```json
"identifier": "http://example.com/publication"
```

Publications can be updated and to identify each specific version, the manifest must also contain a `modified` element containing the timestamp when the publication was last modified expressed as an ISO 8601 time and date:

```json
"modified": "2016-02-22T11:31:38Z"
```

##Title

A Web Publication Manifest must contain a single title using the `title` element:

```json
"title": "Moby-Dick"
```

In addition to a simple string representation, the `title` element also supports alternate representations of the same string in different scripts and languages.

To provide these alternate representations, an object may be used instead of a string, where each key identifies a language/script and must be a valid [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) language tag:

```json
"title": {
  "fr": "Vingt mille lieues sous les mers",
  "en": "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea",
  "ja": "海底二万里"
}
```

The manifest may also contain a `sort_as` element to provide a single sortable string, used by a client to organize a collection of publications:

```json
"title": "A Tale of Two Cities",
"sort_as": "Tale of Two Cities, A"
```

##Contributors

The default context for the Web Publication Manifest provides a number of elements to indicate the nature of a contributor: `author`, `translator`, `editor`, `artist`, `illustrator`, `letterer`, `penciler`, `colorist`, `inker` and `narrator`.

In addition to these elements, it also provides a generic term for contributors: `contributor`.

A Web Publication Manifest should contain one or more contributor.

The most straightforward expression of a contributor is through a simple string:

```json
"author": "James Joyce"
```

Each element can also contain multiple contributors using a simple array:

```json
"artist": ["Shawn McManus", "Colleen Doran", "Bryan Talbot"]
```

In addition to a simple string representation, each contributor can also be represented using an object using the following elements: `name`, `sorted_as` and `identifier`.

When an object is used, it must contain at least `name`. 

It behaves like the `title` element and allows either a simple strings, or representations in multiple languages and scripts of a contributor's name:

```json
"author": {
  "name": {
    "ru": "Михаил Афанасьевич Булгаков",
    "en": "Mikhail Bulgakov",
    "fr": "Mikhaïl Boulgakov"
  }
}
```

The contributor object may also contain a `sort_as` element to provide a single sortable string, used by a client to organize a collection of publications:

```json
"author": {
  "name": "Marcel Proust",
  "sort_as": "Proust, Marcel"
}
```

Finally, the object may also contain an `identifier`. The `identifier` must be a URN.

ISNI (http://isni.org) is the preferred authority, but other sources may also be used:

```json
"author": {
  "name": "Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly",
  "sort_as": "Barbey d'Aurevilly, Jules Amédée",
  "identifier": "http://isni.org/isni/0000000121317806"
}
```
If none of the elements available are specific enough, a `contributor` element may be used instead. 

The `contributor` element should be used with an object that contains a `role`. 
All values for the `role` element should be based on [MARC relator codes](https://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html): 

```json
"contributor": {
  "name": "Lou Reed",
  "role": "sng"
}
```

## Language

In order to indicate its primary language, a Web Publication Manifest should use a `language` element. Its value must be a valid [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) language tag.

```json
"language": "en"
```

If a publication has more than one primary language (a bilingual edition for example), the `language` element may contain an array of BCP 47 language tags:

```json
"language": ["en", "fr", "ja"]
```

## Description

A Web Publication Manifest may contain a description of the publication in plain text using the `description` element:

```json
"description": "The story of two gnomes, discussing the meaning of life in a
Scandivanian garden."
```

## Publisher

A Web Publication Manifest may list one or more publishers using the `publisher` element.

To provide even more details, it's also possible to use the `imprint` element that behaves exactly like `publisher` but provides a complementary information.

The most straightforward expression is through a simple string:

```json
"publisher": "Literary Fiction Ltd.",
"imprint": "World Literature"
```

This element also allows a more complex representation using an object and the following elements: `name`, `sort_as`, `identifier`. The semantics and syntax are identical to contributors:

```json
"publisher": {
  "name": "The Science Fiction Company",
  "sort_as": "Science Fiction Company, The",
  "identifier": "http://example.com/publisher/TheScienceFictionCompany"
}
```

Multiple publishers can be listed in this element using the string or object representations.


## Publication Date

A Web Publication Manifest may contain a publication date using the `published` element. The publication date must be a valid ISO 8601 date.

```json
"published": "2016-09-02"
```

##Subjects

A Web Publication Manifest may also provide one or more subjects using the `subject` element:

```json
"subject": "Historical Fiction"
```

Multiple subjects are listed using an array:

```json
"subject": ["Science Fiction", "Fantasy"]
```

Subjects can also be expressed using an object with the following elements: `name`, `sort_as`, `code` and `scheme`.

`name` is meant to provide a human readable string for the subject, while `sort_as` is meant to provide a string that a machine can sort: 

```json
"subject": {
  "name": "Manga: Shonen",
  "sort_as": "Shonen"
}
```

In many fields and territories, a number of controlled vocabularies are in use to identify subjects. For example THEMA is used in the publishing industry to provide an international subject scheme.

To indicate that a subject belongs to a particular scheme, the `scheme` element is available. In addition to it, the `code` element is available to provide the string that identifies the subject in a given scheme:

```json
"subject": {
  "name": "Manga: Shonen",
  "sort_as": "Shonen",
  "scheme": "THEMA",
  "code": "XAMG"
}
```

##Collections & Series

A Web Publication Manifest may indicate that it belongs to one or multiple collections/series.

`collection` and `series` behave the same way, the most straightforward way to indicate that a publication belongs to a collection/series is through a simple string:

```json
"belongs_to": {
  "collection": "Mysteries from Another Time",
  "series": "The Zombie Detective"
}
```

In order to provide more information about a specific collection/series, an object can also be used instead of a string.

To provide a name and a sortable string, `collection` and `series` support both `name` and `sort_as`:

```json
"belongs_to": {
  "series": {
    "name": "The Zombie Detective",
    "sort_as": "Zombie Detective, The"
  }
}
```

A collection/series can also have an identifier, provided using the `identifier`
element. The identifier must be a URN:

```json
"belongs_to": {
  "series": {
    "name": "The Zombie Detective",
    "sort_as": "Zombie Detective, The",
    "identifier": "http://www.example.com/series/TheZombieDetective"
  }
}
```

Finally, series/collection can be ordered. To provide the position of the current publication in a series/collection, the `position` element can be used.

A position can be either an integer or a float where the value is greater than zero.

```json
"belongs_to": {
  "series": {
    "name": "The Zombie Detective",
    "sort_as": "Zombie Detective, The",
    "identifier": "http://www.example.com/series/TheZombieDetective",
    "position": 4
  }
}
```

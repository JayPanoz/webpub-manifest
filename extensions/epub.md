# EPUB Extension

While EPUB 2.x and 3.x can mostly be mapped directly to the Readium Web Publication Manifest, a number of metadata, collection roles and properties are still very specific to EPUB and not fully covered by the core specification.

Thanks to the various extension points in place, this document defines a number of new properties that are for the most part exclusive to EPUB.
